# cool example of a least squares system for
# pose-landmark
# pose-landmark-projection
# pose-pose constraints
# to test i1:
$octave> TotalLeastSquares
$octave> chi_stats_{l,r,p} 

This shows the chi stat of 
{l} andmarks, or 
{p}rojections or 
{r}obot poses

 goes down.

Could not write something smaller while keeping some order.
